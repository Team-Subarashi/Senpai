<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![splash][splash]

This project was conceptualized and developed between October 4, 2021 to October 21, 2021 for Code Chrysalis' Immersive Bootcamp's Senior Project requirement. This is not an active service.

The idea behind Senpai was to create a platform where programmers could offer 1-on-1 tutorial services for people wanting to learn frontend technologies, and was meant to eliminate the user's need to juggle multiple apps throughout the process such as those for scheduling, video chat, and screensharing.
